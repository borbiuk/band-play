Note: The Tabs API can be used by the service worker and extension pages, but not content scripts.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tabs` API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.
The Tabs API not only offers features for manipulating and managing tabs, but can also detect the
[language](#method-detectLanguage) of the tab, take a [screenshot](#method-captureVisibleTab), and
[communicate](#method-sendMessage) with a tab's content scripts.

## Permissions

Most features don't require any permissions to use. For example: [creating](#method-create) a new tab,
[reloading](#method-reload) a tab, [navigating](#method-update) to another URL, etc.
There are three permissions developers should be aware of when working with the Tabs API.The "tabs" permission
This permission does not give access to the `chrome.tabs` namespace. Instead, it
grants an extension the ability to call `[tabs.query()](#method-query) against four
sensitive properties on `[tabs.Tab](#type-Tab) instances: `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and
`favIconUrl`.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "tabs"
  ],
  ...
}

```

Host permissions
[Host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) allow an extension to read and query a matching tab's four sensitive
`tabs.Tab` properties. They can also interact directly with the matching tabs using methods such
as `[tabs.captureVisibleTab()](#method-captureVisibleTab),
`[scripting.executeScript()](/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting#method-executeScript), `[scripting.insertCSS()](/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting#method-insertCSS), and
`[scripting.removeCSS()](/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting#method-removeCSS).

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

The "activeTab" permission
``[activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) grants an extension temporary host permission for the current tab in
response to a user invocation. Unlike host permissions, `activeTab` does not trigger any warnings.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  ...
}

```

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases.

### Open an extension page in a new tab

A common pattern for extensions is to open an onboarding page in a new tab when the extension is
installed. The following example shows how to do this.
background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({reason}) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: "onboarding.html"
    });
  }
});

```

Note: This example doesn't require any [permissions](#perms).

### Get the current tab

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can retrieve the active tab from the
currently-focused window (or most recently-focused window, if no Chrome windows are focused). This
can usually be thought of as the user's current tab.

```
  async function getCurrentTab() {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
    let [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);
    return tab;
  }

```

```
  function getCurrentTab(callback) {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, ([tab]) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
      console.error(chrome.runtime.lastError);
      // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
      callback(tab);
    });
  }

```

### Mute the specified tab

This example shows how an extension can toggle the muted state for a given tab.

```
  async function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    const tab = await chrome.tabs.get(tabId);
    const muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
    await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {muted});
    console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${muted ? "muted" : "unmuted"}`);
  }

```

```
  function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    chrome.tabs.get(tabId, async (tab) => {
      let muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
      await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { muted });
      console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${ muted ? "muted" : "unmuted" }`);
    });
  }

```

### Move the current tab to the first position when clicked

This example shows how to move a tab while a drag may or may not be in progress. While this example
uses `chrome.tabs.move`, you can use the same waiting pattern for other calls that modify tabs while
a drag is in progress.

```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPosition);

  async function moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo) {
    try {
      await chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, {index: 0});
      console.log("Success.");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
        setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo), 50);
      } else {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  }

```

Important: Using catch(error) in a Promise is a way to ensure that an error that otherwise
populates `chrome.runtime.lastError` is not unchecked.

```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPositionMV2);

  function moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo) {
    chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, { index: 0 }, () => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        const error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
          setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo), 50);
        } else {
          console.error(error);
        }
      } else {
        console.log("Success.");
      }
    });
  }

```

### Pass a message to a selected tab's content script

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can communicate with content scripts in specific browser tabs using `tabs.sendMessage()`.

```
function sendMessageToActiveTab(message) {
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true });
  const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, message);
  // TODO: Do something with the response.
}

```

### ZoomSettings

Defines how zoom changes in a tab are handled and at what scope.

#### Properties

- defaultZoomFactor
  number optionalChrome 43+

Used to return the default zoom level for the current tab in calls to tabs.getZoomSettings.

- mode
  [ZoomSettingsMode](#type-ZoomSettingsMode)optional
  Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.
- scope
  [ZoomSettingsScope](#type-ZoomSettingsScope)optional
  Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.

### ZoomSettingsMode

Chrome 44+

Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.

#### Enum

"automatic"
Zoom changes are handled automatically by the browser.
"manual"
Overrides the automatic handling of zoom changes. The `onZoomChange` event will still be dispatched, and it is the extension's responsibility to listen for this event and manually scale the page. This mode does not support `per-origin` zooming, and thus ignores the `scope` zoom setting and assumes `per-tab`.
"disabled"
Disables all zooming in the tab. The tab reverts to the default zoom level, and all attempted zoom changes are ignored.

### ZoomSettingsScope

Chrome 44+

Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.

#### Enum

"per-origin"
Zoom changes persist in the zoomed page's origin, i.e., all other tabs navigated to that same origin are zoomed as well. Moreover, `per-origin` zoom changes are saved with the origin, meaning that when navigating to other pages in the same origin, they are all zoomed to the same zoom factor. The `per-origin` scope is only available in the `automatic` mode.
"per-tab"
Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs do not affect the zooming of this tab. Also, `per-tab` zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab always loads pages with their `per-origin` zoom factors.

## Properties

### MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND

Chrome 92+

The maximum number of times that `[captureVisibleTab](#method-captureVisibleTab) can be called per second. `[captureVisibleTab](#method-captureVisibleTab) is expensive and should not be called too often.

#### Value

2

### SPLIT_VIEW_ID_NONE

Pending
An ID that represents the absence of a split tab.

#### Value

-1

### TAB_ID_NONE

Chrome 46+

An ID that represents the absence of a browser tab.

#### Value

-1

### TAB_INDEX_NONE

Chrome 123+

An index that represents the absence of a tab index in a tab_strip.

#### Value

-1

## Methods

### captureVisibleTab()

```
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(
