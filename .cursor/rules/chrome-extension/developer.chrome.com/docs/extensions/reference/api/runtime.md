## Description

Use the `chrome.runtime` API to retrieve the service worker, return details about the manifest, and listen for and respond to events in the extension lifecycle. You can also use this API to convert the relative path of URLs to fully-qualified URLs.

Most members of this API do not require any permissions. This permission is needed for `[connectNative()](#method-connectNative), `[sendNativeMessage()](#method-sendNativeMessage) and ``[onNativeConnect](#event-onConnectNative).
The following example shows how to declare the `"nativeMessaging"` permission in the manifest:
manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "nativeMessaging"
  ],
  ...
}

```

## Concepts and usage

The Runtime API provides methods to support a number of areas that your extensions
can use:Message passingYour extension can communicate with different contexts within your extension and also with other extensions using these methods and events:
`[connect()](#method-connect),
`[onConnect](#event-onConnect),
`[onConnectExternal](#event-onConnectExternal),
`[sendMessage()](#method-sendMessage),
`[onMessage](#event-onMessage) and
`[onMessageExternal](#event-onMessageExternal).
In addition, your extension can pass messages to native applications on the user's device using
`[connectNative()](#method-connectNative) and
`[sendNativeMessage()](#method-sendNativeMessage).Note: See [Message Passing](/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging) for an overview of the subject.Accessing extension and platform metadataThese methods let you retrieve several specific pieces of metadata about the extension and the
platform. Methods in this category include
`[getManifest()](#method-getManifest), and
`[getPlatformInfo()](#method-getPlatformInfo).Managing extension lifecycle and optionsThese properties let you perform some meta-operations on the extension, and display the options page.
Methods and events in this category include
`[onInstalled](#event-onInstalled),
`[onStartup](#event-onStartup),
`[openOptionsPage()](#method-openOptionsPage),
`[reload()](#method-reload),
`[requestUpdateCheck()](#method-requestUpdateCheck), and
`[setUninstallURL()](#method-setUninstallURL).Helper utilitiesThese methods provide utility such as the conversion of internal resource representations to
external formats. Methods in this category include
`[getURL()](#method-getURL).Kiosk mode utilitiesThese methods are available only on ChromeOS, and exist mainly to support kiosk implementations.
Methods in this category include
`[restart()](#method-restart) and
``[restartAfterDelay()`](#method-restartAfterDelay).

### Unpacked extension behavior

When an [unpacked](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) extension is [reloaded](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#reload), this is treated as an update. This means that the
``[chrome.runtime.onInstalled](#event-onInstalled) event will fire with the `"update"` reason. This
includes when the extension is reloaded with ``[chrome.runtime.reload()](#method-reload).

## Use cases

### Add an image to a web page

For a web page to access an asset hosted on another domain, it must specify the resource's full URL
(e.g. `<img src="https://example.com/logo.png">`). The same is true to include an extension asset on
a web page. The two differences are that the extension's assets must be exposed as [web
accessible resources](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) and that typically content scripts are responsible for injecting
extension assets.
In this example, the extension will add `logo.png` to the page that the [content
script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) is being [injected](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality) into by using `runtime.getURL()` to create a
fully-qualified URL. But first, the asset must be declared as a web accessible resource in the manifest.
manifest.json:

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "logo.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://*/*" ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

content.js:

```
{ // Block used to avoid setting global variables
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('logo.png');
  document.body.append(img);
}

```

### Send data from a content script to the service worker

Its common for an extension's content scripts to need data managed by another part of the extension,
like the service worker. Much like two browser windows opened to the same web page, these
two contexts cannot directly access each other's values. Instead, the extension can use [message
passing](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) to coordinate across these different contexts.
In this example, the content script needs some data from the extension's service worker to
initialize its UI. To get this data, it passes the developer-defined `get-user-data` message
to the service worker, and it responds with a copy of the user's information.
content.js:

```
// 1. Send a message to the service worker requesting the user's data
chrome.runtime.sendMessage('get-user-data', (response) => {
  // 3. Got an asynchronous response with the data from the service worker
  console.log('received user data', response);
  initializeUI(response);
});

```

service-worker.js:

```
// Example of a simple user data object
const user = {
  username: 'demo-user'
};

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // 2. A page requested user data, respond with a copy of `user`
  if (message === 'get-user-data') {
    sendResponse(user);
  }
});

```

### Gather feedback on uninstall

Many extensions use post-uninstall surveys to understand how the extension could better serve its
users and improve retention. The following example shows how to add this functionality.
background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(details => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL('https://example.com/extension-survey');
  }
});

```

## Methods

### connect()

```
chrome.runtime.connect(
  extensionId?: string,
  connectInfo?: object,
): [Port](#type-Port)
```

Attempts to connect listeners within an extension (such as the background page), or other extensions/apps. This is useful for content scripts connecting to their extension processes, inter-app/extension communication, and [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable). Note that this does not connect to any listeners in a content script. Extensions may connect to content scripts embedded in tabs via ``[tabs.connect](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-connect).

#### Parameters

- extensionId
  string optional
  The ID of the extension to connect to. If omitted, a connection will be attempted with your own extension. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable).
- connectInfo
  object optional

- includeTlsChannelId
  boolean optional
  Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onConnectExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
- name
  string optional
  Will be passed into onConnect for processes that are listening for the connection event.

#### Returns

[Port](#type-Port)
Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port's [onDisconnect](#type-Port) event is fired if the extension does not exist.

### connectNative()

```
chrome.runtime.connectNative(
  application: string,
): [Port](#type-Port)
```

Connects to a native application in the host machine. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission. See [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) for more information.

#### Parameters

- application
  string
  The name of the registered application to connect to.

#### Returns

[Port](#type-Port)
Port through which messages can be sent and received with the application

### getBackgroundPage()

        Foreground only

        Deprecated since Chrome 133

```
chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(): Promise<Window | undefined>
```

Background pages do not exist in MV3 extensions.

Retrieves the JavaScript 'window' object for the background page running inside the current extension/app. If the background page is an event page, the system will ensure it is loaded before calling the callback. If there is no background page, an error is set.

#### Returns

Promise<Window | undefined>Chrome 99+

### getContexts()

Chrome 116+
MV3+

```
chrome.runtime.getContexts(
  filter: [ContextFilter](#type-ContextFilter),
): Promise<[ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]>
```

Fetches information about active contexts associated with this extension

#### Parameters

- filter
  [ContextFilter](#type-ContextFilter)
  A filter to find matching contexts. A context matches if it matches all specified fields in the filter. Any unspecified field in the filter matches all contexts.

#### Returns

Promise<[ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]>
Promise that resolves with the matching contexts, if any.

### getManifest()

```
chrome.runtime.getManifest(): object
```

Returns details about the app or extension from the manifest. The object returned is a serialization of the full [manifest file](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

#### Returns

object
The manifest details.

### getPackageDirectoryEntry()

        Foreground only

```
chrome.runtime.getPackageDirectoryEntry(): Promise<DirectoryEntry>
```

Returns a DirectoryEntry for the package directory.

#### Returns

Promise<DirectoryEntry>Chrome 122+

### getPlatformInfo()

```
chrome.runtime.getPlatformInfo(): Promise<[PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)>
```

Returns information about the current platform.

#### Returns

Promise<[PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)>Chrome 99+

Promise that resolves with information about the current platform.

### getURL()

```
chrome.runtime.getURL(
  path: string,
): string
```

Converts a relative path within an app/extension install directory to a fully-qualified URL.

#### Parameters

- path
  string
  A path to a resource within an app/extension expressed relative to its install directory.

#### Returns

string
The fully-qualified URL to the resource.

### getVersion()

Chrome 143+

```
chrome.runtime.getVersion(): string
```

Returns the extension's version as declared in the manifest.

#### Returns

string
The extension's version.

### openOptionsPage()

```
chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage(): Promise<void>
```

Open your Extension's options page, if possible.
The precise behavior may depend on your manifest's `[options_ui](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options) or `[options_page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#full_page) key, or what Chrome happens to support at the time. For example, the page may be opened in a new tab, within chrome://extensions, within an App, or it may just focus an open options page. It will never cause the caller page to reload.
If your Extension does not declare an options page, or Chrome failed to create one for some other reason, the callback will set ``[lastError](#property-lastError).

#### Returns

Promise<void>Chrome 99+

### reload()

```
chrome.runtime.reload(): void
```

Reloads the app or extension. This method is not supported in kiosk mode. For kiosk mode, use chrome.runtime.restart() method.

### requestUpdateCheck()

```
chrome.runtime.requestUpdateCheck(): Promise<object>
```

Requests an immediate update check be done for this app/extension.
Important: Most extensions/apps should not use this method, since Chrome already does automatic checks every few hours, and you can listen for the ``[runtime.onUpdateAvailable](#event-onUpdateAvailable) event without needing to call requestUpdateCheck.
This method is only appropriate to call in very limited circumstances, such as if your extension talks to a backend service, and the backend service has determined that the client extension version is very far out of date and you'd like to prompt a user to update. Most other uses of requestUpdateCheck, such as calling it unconditionally based on a repeating timer, probably only serve to waste client, network, and server resources.
Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Returns

Promise<object>Chrome 109+

### restart()

```
chrome.runtime.restart(): void
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode. Otherwise, it's no-op.

### restartAfterDelay()

Chrome 53+

```
chrome.runtime.restartAfterDelay(
  seconds: number,
): Promise<void>
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode after the given seconds. If called again before the time ends, the reboot will be delayed. If called with a value of -1, the reboot will be cancelled. It's a no-op in non-kiosk mode. It's only allowed to be called repeatedly by the first extension to invoke this API.

#### Parameters

- seconds
  number
  Time to wait in seconds before rebooting the device, or -1 to cancel a scheduled reboot.

#### Returns

Promise<void>Chrome 99+

Promise that resolves when a restart request was successfully rescheduled.

### sendMessage()

```
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
  extensionId?: string,
  message: any,
  options?: object,
): Promise<any>
```

Sends a single message to event listeners within your extension or a different extension/app. Similar to `[runtime.connect](#method-connect) but only sends a single message, with an optional response. If sending to your extension, the `[runtime.onMessage](#event-onMessage) event will be fired in every frame of your extension (except for the sender's frame), or `[runtime.onMessageExternal](#event-onMessageExternal), if a different extension. Note that extensions cannot send messages to content scripts using this method. To send messages to content scripts, use `[tabs.sendMessage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage).

#### Parameters

- extensionId
  string optional
  The ID of the extension to send the message to. If omitted, the message will be sent to your own extension/app. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).
- message
  any
  The message to send. This message should be a JSON-ifiable object.
- options
  object optional

- includeTlsChannelId
  boolean optional
  Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onMessageExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.

#### Returns

Promise<any>Chrome 99+

Promise support was added for extension contexts in Chrome 99. When communicating from a web page to an extension, promises are available from Chrome 118.

### sendNativeMessage()

```
chrome.runtime.sendNativeMessage(
  application: string,
  message: object,
): Promise<any>
```

Send a single message to a native application. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission.

#### Parameters

  string
  The name of the native messaging host.
- message
  object
  The message that will be passed to the native messaging host.

#### Returns

Promise<any>Chrome 99+

### setUninstallURL()

```
chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL(
  url: string,
): Promise<void>
```

Sets the URL to be visited upon uninstallation. This may be used to clean up server-side data, do analytics, and implement surveys. Maximum 1023 characters.

#### Parameters

  URL to be opened after the extension is uninstalled. This URL must have an http: or https: scheme. Set an empty string to not open a new tab upon uninstallation.

#### Returns

Promise<void>Chrome 99+

Promise that resolves when the uninstall URL is set. If the given URL is invalid, the promise will be rejected.

  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when an app or the device that it runs on needs to be restarted. The app should close all its windows at its earliest convenient time to let the restart to happen. If the app does nothing, a restart will be enforced after a 24-hour grace period has passed. Currently, this event is only fired for Chrome OS kiosk apps.

#### Parameters

  function

                              The `callback` parameter looks like:

### onStartup

```
chrome.runtime.onStartup.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when a profile that has this extension installed first starts up. This event is not fired when an incognito profile is started, even if this extension is operating in 'split' incognito mode.

#### Parameters

- callback
  function

                              The `callback` parameter looks like:

```
() => void
```

### onSuspend

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspend.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Sent to the event page just before it is unloaded. This gives the extension opportunity to do some clean up. Note that since the page is unloading, any asynchronous operations started while handling this event are not guaranteed to complete. If more activity for the event page occurs before it gets unloaded the onSuspendCanceled event will be sent and the page won't be unloaded.

#### Parameters

- callback
  function

                              The `callback` parameter looks like:

```
() => void
```

### onSuspendCanceled

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspendCanceled.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Sent after onSuspend to indicate that the app won't be unloaded after all.

#### Parameters

- callback
  function

                              The `callback` parameter looks like:

```
() => void
```

### onUpdateAvailable

```
chrome.runtime.onUpdateAvailable.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call chrome.runtime.reload(). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call chrome.runtime.reload() manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time Chrome itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if chrome.runtime.reload() is called in response to this event.

#### Parameters

- callback
  function

                              The `callback` parameter looks like:

```
(details: object) => void
```

- details
  object

- version
  string
  The version number of the available update.
