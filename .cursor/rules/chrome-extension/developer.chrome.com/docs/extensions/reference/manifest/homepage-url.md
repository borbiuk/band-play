An optional manifest key containing a string for a valid homepage URL. Developers may choose to set the extension's homepage to their personal or company's website. If the parameter is left undefined, the default homepage will be the extension's Chrome Web Store page listed on the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). This field is particularly useful if you [host the extension on your own site](/docs/extensions/mv3/hosting).

```
{
  // ...
  "homepage_url": "https://example.com,",
  // ...
}
```
