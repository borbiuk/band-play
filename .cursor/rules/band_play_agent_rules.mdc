description: Agent rules and safety constraints for this repository (Band Play).
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Code changes**
  - Follow existing project conventions (code style, folder structure, naming, dependency management) unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
  - Never perform refactoring unless explicitly requested.
  - Apply only the changes directly required for the current request.
  - Keep changes minimal, explicit, and localized to the requested task.
  - Ensure modifications are clear, readable, and consistent with the existing code style.
  - Always use a block `if-return` statement (avoid inline one-liners for clarity).

- **Git and workflow safety**
  - Never perform these git commands automatically:
    - `commit`, `reset`, `rebase`, `push`, `pull --force`, `checkout --force`, `clean`, `stash drop`
  - Always ask for user confirmation before running:
    - `git pull`, `git merge`, `git stash`

- **Language**
  - All comments and documentation must be in English.
  - The answer must be in the same language as the question.
