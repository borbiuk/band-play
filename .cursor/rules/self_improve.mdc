- **Rule improvement triggers**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently

- **Analysis process**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Prefer examples from the actual codebase

- **Rule updates**
  - **Add new rules when**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Code review feedback repeats the same points
    - A rule can prevent common bugs/security issues
  - **Modify existing rules when**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Rule quality checks**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
