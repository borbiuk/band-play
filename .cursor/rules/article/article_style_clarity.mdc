- **Write like a modern human**
  - Use raw, short, punchy, conversational language when appropriate.
  - If you would never say something in real life, do not write it that way.
  - Prefer short sentences when explaining complex topics.

- **Structure is non-negotiable**
  - The article must have a clear spine: lead → point A → point B → point C → conclusion.
  - Each section must have one main idea and a clear transition to the next.
  - Work both levels of structure:
    - Macro: logical unrolling from paragraph to paragraph
    - Micro: sentence variety (avoid repetitive forms)

- **Play your ace card early**
  - Put the most valuable insight/step near the top (lead + nut graf).
  - Don’t hide the payoff until the end.

- **Be a guide, not a lecturer**
  - Explain trade-offs and alternatives briefly.
  - Anticipate common mistakes and show how to avoid them.
  - Write “hand in hand” with the reader: explore what you do not know yet, not just what you know.

- **Always answer “So what?”**
  - Every major section should connect to a user problem, benefit, or decision.
  - Make the link to the reader explicit (actionable instruction or universal themes).

- **It’s not about you**
  - Even when using first-person, the article should not be about the author.
  - The author is a conduit for experience/meaning; the reader should “look through your eyes”, not at you.

- **Show, don’t label**
  - Replace vague judgments (“awesome”, “bad”) with observable facts, outcomes, or examples.
  - The writer is the cause; the reader is the effect: describe details that create the impression in the reader.

- **Avoid clichés and filler**
  - Remove stock phrases and overused idioms (“idiom crutch”).
  - Cut repeated ideas; prefer one strong example over multiple weak ones.
  - Prefer fresh, specific imagery over worn-out expressions.

- **Spelling counts**
  - Proofread for grammar, punctuation, and names (professionalism signal).
