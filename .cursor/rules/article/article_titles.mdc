- **Treat titling as a skill**
  - Titles are as essential as the body; do not treat them as an afterthought.
  - Poor title can sink excellent content.

- **Be clear, not clever**
  - Titles are not supposed to be enigmatic.
  - Your title should tell the reader:
    - WHO the article is for
    - WHAT it is about
    - WHY they must read it (the promise)
  - If the title confuses the reader, you have lost the reader.
  - Every time you draft a title, ask:
    - “Does this title clearly state WHO it is for, WHAT it is about, and WHY they must read it?”

- **Write many variants**
  - Rewrite titles at least 10 times.
  - Very rarely is the first title the best title.
  - More iterations improve:
    - clarity and “instinctive perfection”
    - idea generation (more iterations = more writing ideas)
  - Definition:
    - A “perfect title” is clear, irresistible, and instinctively feels perfect.

- **Use How / Why / What / Where / Numbers**
  - These elements work because they set expectations and signal solutions.
  - **Numbers**
    - Work well for listicles because readers know exactly what they will get.
    - Prefer concrete, specific numbers.
    - Odd numbers can be especially attention-grabbing; use them only when they match the content.
  - **How-to**
    - Old-fashioned but effective: readers want solutions.

- **Maintain a curiosity gap (without clickbait)**
  - Clear titles are good; bland titles are worse.
  - Add a “surprise element” that makes the reader think “This should be interesting”.
  - Curiosity gap is not clickbait; the article must deliver on the promise.
  - Pattern:
    - Clear + Curiosity gap > Clear-only

- **Speak to the reader**
  - Use “you” and “your” to make the benefit feel directly applicable to the reader.
  - “You/your” works when it addresses a reader pain point and implies practical solutions.

- **Quality checks**
  - Avoid generic, vague, confusing, or bland titles.
  - The title should help the reader quickly decide whether the article is for them.
  - If the title promises a result, the body must include steps/evidence that deliver it.
