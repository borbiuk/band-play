- **Use Cursor to accelerate writing, not to invent facts**
  - Never fabricate APIs, Chrome/Manifest details, or library behavior.
  - When unsure, search official docs and cite them in the article.

- **Recommended interaction pattern**
  - Ask Cursor for:
    - target reader + promise statement (WHO/WHAT/WHY)
    - 3–5 outline options (then pick one and refine)
    - title variants (10–20) and a “curiosity gap” rewrite pass
    - section-by-section drafts (one section at a time)
    - a “so what?” pass per section (why the reader should care)
    - clarity rewrites (shorter, simpler)
    - tone normalization (consistent voice)
    - an editing checklist derived from the current draft (filler words, “which” clauses, transitions)
  - Avoid asking Cursor to write the whole article at once (hard to verify and edit).

- **Technical correctness**
  - Any code snippet must be runnable or obviously illustrative.
  - Prefer referencing real files in this repo (paths like `src/background/background.ts`).
  - Validate build steps against `package.json` scripts (root vs `example/`).

- **Evidence and credibility**
  - For claims about MV3, permissions, or Chrome APIs, include at least one authoritative reference.
  - For performance or sizing claims, include numbers and how they were measured.
  - Maintain a source-note section while drafting (links + what each link supports), then integrate into the final article.

- **Editing checklist (Cursor-assisted)**
  - Ask Cursor to:
    - list ambiguous sentences
    - find missing prerequisites
    - detect broken promises (title/intro vs body)
    - propose tighter headings and bullet lists
    - generate a “common pitfalls” section
    - flag where the article becomes “selfie writing” (too author-centric) and suggest reader-focused rewrites
