  - **Main points in bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File references**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` to reference files.
  - Prefer referencing real project files over theoretical examples.

- **Code examples**
  - Use language-specific code blocks.
  - Prefer **DO** / **DON'T** pairs when they improve clarity.

- **Rule content guidelines**
  - Start with a short, high-level overview.
  - Include specific, actionable requirements.
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules when appropriate.

- **Maintenance**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge in the codebase.
  - Remove outdated guidance promptly.
  - Keep descriptions concise and consistent.
