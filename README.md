| :-------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     `Space`     | Pause/Play the current track                                        |
|       `N`       | Play the next Track                                                 |
|       `B`       | Play the previous Track                                             |
|       `O`       | Open the current Track in new tab                                   |
|       `P`       | Enable or disable auto pitch (usable whe playback speed is changed) |
|   `Shift`+`O`   | Reset auto pitch                                                    |
|   `Shift`+`O`   | Open the current Track in new tab and focus on it                   |
|       `L`       | Add or Remove Track from wishlist                                   |
|      `0-9`      | Play the current track with progress `(Digit * 10)%` \*             |
|  `Shift`+`0-9`  | Play the track by index                                             |
|     `‚Üê` `‚Üí`     | Move track playback back or forward on `step` seconds               |
|     `‚Üë` `‚Üì`     | Increase or decrease track playback speed on `3.03%` \*\*           |
| `Shift`+`‚Üë`/`‚Üì` | Reset track playback speed                                          |

1. \* For example, pressing key `3` will set the track playback to `30%` of all duration.
2. \*\* the same as one rotation of a vinyl per minute.

Please note that customization of hotkeys is not available in the current version.
